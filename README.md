The recommendation system plays an essential role in the modern era and used by many
prestigious applications. The recommendation system has made the collection of apps,
creating a global village, and growth for abundant information. The recommendation
system consists of Collaborative Filtering, Content-based, and hybrid-based approaches.
Our project will represent an overview of Approaches and techniques generated in the
Collaborative Filtering based recommendation system. It classifies collaborative filtering
using various approaches like vectorisation, matrix factorization, user-based
recommendation, cosine distance and item-based recommendation. We extract aspectbased specific ratings from reviews and also recommend reviews to users depends on
user similarity and their rating patterns. Finally, validating the proposed movie
recommendation system for various evaluation criteria, and also the proposed system shows
